This is a simple example for desigen pattern observer & microkernel architecture in this project You see how it works.

#MikroKernel
A microkernel architecture is called a plugin architecture because of the way capabilities and functionality are added to a minimal core OS.
They're an efficient way to achieve application customization and can offer software lifecycle benefits.

# Desigen Pattern Observer
